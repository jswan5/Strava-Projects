# Strava-Projects
Collection of projects using personal Strava data

All Strava data scraped from Strava website using Golden Cheetah (https://www.goldencheetah.org/) recorded via Suunto 5 watch.

CadencePace predicts speed using multiple regression. Cadence being the most highly correlated metric (r>0.7 in all iterations) it's been
included in all regressions. Other metrics (HR, altitude, slope) have much smaller effects.
